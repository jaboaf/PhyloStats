- BAM files submitted to GDC:
	- split by read groups
	- converted to FASTQ
- If a read does not pass Illumina's Chastity Test, then it is removed.
- Alignment is the next step. This step eliminates data and arranges data.
	- [BWA](https://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/) stands for Burrows-Wheeler Aligner. Manual for the tool that does the aligning is here: https://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml . 
	- Alignment for reads longer than 200 bases ["long read alignment"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2828108/)
	- Alignment for reads between 32 and 100 bases ["short read alignment"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2705234/)
	- Both use the [Burrowsâ€“Wheeler transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrows%E2%80%93Wheeler_transform)
	- The NCI GDC uses
		-[BWA-MEM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.3997.pdf) when mean read length is longer than 70 bases (repo: https://github.com/lh3/mem-paper)
		- and BWA-aln otherwise.
